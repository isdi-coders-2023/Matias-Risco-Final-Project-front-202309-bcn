# VALVEPIPE

**ValvePipe** is a Single Page Application developed with **React** and **Redux** that allows you to manage a game's collection. With this application, users can perform **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their game's collection in a simple and efficient way.

Firstly, the page was designed in **Figma** to outline all the interface styles that would be later implemented using **Styled Components** in each of the created components, always with a strong focus on **accessibility** for all users. Thus, ensuring suitable color contrast, adding alternative text to images and more.

Throughout the application development, **version control** was managed via **GIT**, following a **CI/CD** workflow in the pipeline, such as trunk-based development, overseeing all the code that was committed to the master branch using **husky** hooks, among others. For maintaining code quality practices, tools like **Eslint** and **Prettier** were utilized. **Lighthouse** was employed to monitor **accessibility**, **best practices**, **SEO**, and performance aspects.
